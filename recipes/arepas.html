    <p>Arepas are round corn patties that are grilled and eaten almost daily in Colombia and Venezuela in the same way people in the U.S. eat bread with a meal. These arepas are often served with cheese, butter, or even avocado. Arepas can also be cut open and filled with a variety of savory ingredients </p>
    
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Directions </h2>

    <p>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.

    <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle</p>
    
    <p>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket</p>
